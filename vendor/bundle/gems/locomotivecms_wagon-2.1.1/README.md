Wagon is a command line tool that let's you develop for Locomotive right on your local machine.

With Wagon, you can generate the scaffolding for a new Locomotive site and start adding the content types and templates you need using any text editor. And thanks to Wagon's built-in web server, you can preview the site with your computer's web browser.

Wagon can also deploy sites to any Locomotive Engine using the wagon deploy command. Your changes will immediately be reflected on that site without restarting or making any changes to the Engine server app.

To help you work faster, Wagon comes with support for tools like SASS, LESS, HAML, and CoffeeScript. It also works well with source version control systems like git and svn.

**Note:** The previous version of Wagon (v1.5.8) is available in the *[v1.5.x](https://github.com/locomotivecms/wagon/tree/v1.5.x)* branch
